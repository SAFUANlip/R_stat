# A study is conducted to analyze the impact of environmental conditions, seasonal variation, and geographic location
# on the growth rate of trees in a forest reserve between May and July 2023. The dataset treegrowth.txt reports the
# daily growth measurements of trees in di!erent parts of the forest. It includes the UTM geographical coordinates
# s_i of the trees, a categorical variable season indicating if the measurement was taken in early or late summer
# (early for May–June and late for July), the recorded average daily soil moisture moisturei (in percentage), and
# the observed growth rate y(si) [mm/day]. Consider the following model:

# y(si) = b0,j + b1moisturei + ω(si) 
# where ω(si) represents stationary residuals with spherical variogram with nugget, and j = 0, 1 corresponds to the
# grouping induced by the variable season (j = 0 for early, j = 1 for late).

treegrowth <- read.table("treegrowth.txt", h=TRUE)

## Define the sample coordinates (transform Table to SpatialPointsDataFrame)

# a) Report a plot of the fitted variogram, initialising the variogram fit with the model vgm(0.1, "Sph", 1000,
# 0.1). Indicate the estimate of the range and the sill.

# Range - 1161.639
# sill SUM OF sill from Nugget and Spherical part 0.09237614+0.08322185 = 0.175598

# and b1 using the generalized least squares method.

# soil moisture of 25%.

# there for I had to multiply by 31 (because our data reports DAILY growth)

# d) Due to their environment, trees can be categorized as growing in canopy-covered areas (canopy=TRUE) or in
# open areas (canopy=FALSE). Modify the model in Eq. (1), including this categorical effect, as follows:
#        y(si) = b0,j,k + b1,k moisturei + ω(si)
# where ω(si) represents stationary residuals with exponential variogram without nugget, and k is the grouping
# induced by the variable canopy.

# How would you describe the effect of the canopy variable (during early summer)?
# It has positive effect, sue to coefficent > 0, so canopy helps trees growth 
# also Coefficents with canopy (TRUE) has higher value, so it has better effect for
# trees growth, compared to open-airs
