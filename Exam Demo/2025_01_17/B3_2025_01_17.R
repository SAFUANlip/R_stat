# The file temperature.txt contains the yearly average air temperature (y(si),
# in degrees Celsius) at 60 locations si in the Alpine region surrounding the Aletsch Glacier.
# The dataset includes the UTM coordinates (x, y) of the
# locations si, whether the measurement site is north-oriented (orient = N),
# south-oriented (orient = S) or either
# east or west-oriented (orient = EW), and the elevation of the location e(si) (in kilometers).
# Consider the following model for air temperature estimation:

# y(si) = ω0,g + ω1,g· e(si) + ε(si)

# where ε(si) is a 2nd order stationary residual with an exponential
# variogram without nugget e!ect, and g = 0, 1, 2
# represents the grouping induced by the variable orient
# (g = 0 for orient = N, g = 1 for orient = EW and g = 2 for orient = S).

# a) In Eq. 2, assume ω1,g = ω1 for g = 0, 1, 2 and fit the model. Report a plot of the fitted variogram, initialising
# the variogram fit with the model vgm(0.2, "Exp", 1000). Indicate the estimate of the range and the sill.

#    model    psill    range
# 1   Exp   0.767535 196.8432
#            0.768.  196.8432

# NOTE, when we use Exp variogram, range will not coincide with plot
# we have to multiply it by 3
# so in our case it will be 196.8432 * 3 = 590.5296 now it closer to the value,
# that we see on plot

# b) Using the model fitted in part (a), estimate the yearly average air temperature y→(s0) at the Jungfraujoch
# station which is located at s0 = (5140000, 427000), west-oriented, at an altitude of 3450m.

# slope, all other things being equal?

# d) Relaxing the assumption made in a) fit the model indicated by Eq. 2. Indicate the estimate of the sill, fitting
# the variogram with the same initialisation as in a). Should this model be preferred to the first one? Justify
# your answer.

# Second model shoul be more preferable due it it takes into account difference of
# temperature depending on elevation among regions 
# Also model d) has lower psill, which may say about better spatial variation
# and bigger range may say about more smoother variogram
