# The file temperature.txt contains hourly temperature measurements (in degrees Celsius) recorded in Milan
# throughout the year 2023. Each row corresponds to one of the 365 days, and each column represents one of
# the 25 hourly time points from 00:00 to 24:00 (h0 to h24). Additionally,
# each day is labeled according to the season
# (Winter, Spring, Summer, or Autumn) through the variable season.
# We take a functional data analysis perspective, treating the hourly temperature profiles as discretized evaluations
# of smooth functions defined over the domain [0, 24].

# a) Apply penalized smoothing to the temperature data using a basis of quadratic B-splines, with knots placed at
# each observed time point (i.e., every hour). Penalize the first-order derivative and use a smoothing parameter
# of Ï‰ = 1. Report the number of splines used and the mean generalized cross-validation (GCV) error. Provide
# a plot of the smoothed temperature curves. What is the approximate dimension of the space in which the
# smoothed curves live?

plot(scores[, 1] ~ as.factor(season)) # by PC1 we see difference among Summer, Winter and Autumn wiht Spring
plot(scores[, 2] ~ as.factor(season)) # by PC2 it's difficlut to ifnd difference among seasons

# e) Could we successfully classify seasons based on the representation given by the second principal component?
# Justify your answer.

# No we can not sucesssfully classify seasons based on PC2 because there are almost no differnece among seasons in that PC
# we can see in from plot of PC1-PC2 or from Plot of PC2
